## REU-CFS 2023: Computing for Structure

This is the github for the 2023 edition of the 
<a href="https://www.cs.miami.edu/reu-cfs/2023/index.html">REU-CFS</a>, a NSF sponored Research Experience for Undergraduates 
at the University of Miami with PI Burton Rosenberg.

#### First things first.

The bootcamp is to establish a common best of practice for scientific computation. These are to be elements that assist you in your summer project with your mentor. Those elements are, 

- [Python](https://docs.python.org/3/)
- [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/)
- [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) also the [install instructions](./jupyter-install.md)
- [Github](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2), instructions to  [install git](./git-install.md)
- SSH [getting started](./ssh-instruction.md)
- the Unix command line see the [mini-course](https://www.cs.miami.edu/home/burt/learning/unixmini/)

### Python the Language

This is a learning trail for Python. It aims to be of too little help if you do not know Python, and too much help if you do. 
This size fits none.

What it is meant to do, is to resume quickly the important points, particularly for programmers already familiar with some other language. 
This presentation tends to highlight where Python is different, and highlight what I feel are the most iconic, and most useful, aspects
of the language. It will range unhindered by a purity of topic, in order to achieve a unity of aim: to program rapidly and well.

1. [The boom program](https://github.com/burtr/reu-cfs/blob/master/reu-cfs-2023/python-the-language/1_BoomProgram.ipynb). 
This first chapter uses the Boom program to illustrate the syntax of the language, to get the reader to the point of writing something.
1. [Data types](https://github.com/burtr/reu-cfs/blob/master/reu-cfs-2023/python-the-language/2_PythonDatatypes.ipynb).
This second chapter attempts to point out to the Python learner what data types you will be using, and should be using.
1. [The execution model](https://github.com/burtr/reu-cfs/blob/master/reu-cfs-2023/python-the-language/3_execution_model.ipynb).
This third chapter is a more sophisticated look at the language. It might be something new for many programmers, as this information
is generally just found in the reference manuals. But that leaves the work-a-day programmer without a correct model of the language's framework.
1. [Assertion programming](https://github.com/burtr/reu-cfs/blob/master/reu-cfs-2023/python-the-language/4_assertion_programming.ipynb).
One might think this fourth chapter should not be here, as it is about things totally different. However, this learning trail's
goal is success at the entire programming bundle: the language, its innate switfness in implemenation\,
its semantic nuances and grace, and that one writes programs that are correct. Hence loop invariants and assertion programming.

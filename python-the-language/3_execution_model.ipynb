    "The Python programming language began around 1990, designed by Guido van Rossum. It is a modern interpreted language supporting a high level of convenience and data abstraction. It competes with Ruby and somewhat with PERL for a universal next-generation language. In the desire to apply Python to scientific problems, the SciPy project provides libraries for highly efficient scientific computation. SciPy is packaged so that it can be installed easily. As a final layer, Jupyter provides a sort of integrated environment of documentation, editing and running Python programs in frameworks called Notebooks.\n",

    "#### Namespaces, scoping, and the Excution Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Recursion and recursive solutions lead to a discussion of how names are associated with values. In recursion, a mystery arises: how can the same name, in this case x, appear in the text once yet seem to contain multiple values during the recursion. The mystery is explained by the excution model that creates a _namespace_ with each entry to the function, and another when the function is entered again, and another, as often as required for the recursion. A namespace is a collection of _bindings_, and a binding is a name-value pair. \n",
    "\n",
    "When a name is encountered, a search is made for a binding of the name in one or more namespaces. The namespace searched depends both on runtime events, according to the _execution model_, and static text of the program, according to the _scope_. The static text analysis is called _lexical scoping_.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the define is evaluted, a function object is created and bound the given name. And the lexical scope of the names are determined. The names inside the function, including the names of the arguments to the function, belong to the _local scope_ of that function. (N.B. Unless it is determined that it belongs to an enclosing scope, or an explicitly stated scope.) Names that occur outside of any define (or class definition, c.f.) are in the _global scope_.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: In boom_stacking, boom_stacking is in the _global scope_ that contains all top-level defines. Names x, level and indent are in the _local scope_ of the function boom_stacking, and the name i is in the local scope of the function indent. \n",
    "\n",
    "When a function is entered, a namespace is created for the bindings of the names in the local scope. The names of the arguments are entered into then namespace, bound to the values they receive from the call. As names are encountered in the scope, they are either bound with initial values, rebound with new values, or the value bound to the name is used. If a name is used before bound, an UnboundLocalError is raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the function exits, its namespace is forgotten. \n",
    "\n",
    "A binding cannot occur before a namespace exists to contain the binding. The global namespace is created at the start of the Python session, so as global names are encountered, bindings are entered. The _lifetime_ of the global namespace is co-extensive with the session run. However, a local namespace only exists while the function is executing. Its lifetime is co-extensive with the run of the function. While a name's local scope is determined when the define is encountered, a binding for the name must wait until the function is run and a namespace created.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mystery of recursion is then solved as follows. With each recursive call the machine model creates a fresh namespace. The names in local scope are entered in to this namespace as they encountered (including the formals which appear to be encountered immediately). The previous namespace continues to exist, but its name bindings are not used. When the function returns the machine model dissolves the recursive namespace and the previous name bindings are recovered.\n",

Also, defines can nest, and an inner define might use a name in the scope of an outer define. The name might be in the scope of the inner define, the outer define, or in global scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example. This occurs in our boom program, as the name boom is in global scope, but the recursive call uses the name boom possibly in local scope. However, it can't be the case that the boom name inside the boom function is in local scope, as boom is not a bound name in the local namespace. So that occurnace of the name should refer to the global scope, and meaning is that the boom function shoule be re-entered.\n",
    "\n",
    "We consider the simple case of a name in both local and global scope. Here is the rule by which this is decided:\n",
    "\n",
    "> If a variable is ambiguously in both a global and local scope, if the variable is ever written into, the scope shall be local and the binding in the local namespace is used; if the variable is always and only read, the scope shall be global and the global namespace is used. The formal parameters if a function are in local scope.\n",

    "It is to be emphasized that the scoping is determined when the define is encountered. Python uses _lexical scoping_. That means that the scope of a name is determined when the define is evaluated.
